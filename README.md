# Dice Cricket in VB.net & Forms
When I started college (UK) students who applied where given tasks called a "Headstart" these were basically just homework/educational tasks to do before starting. One task was to learn VB.net by writing a Dice-Cricket game in Microsoft forms. Since this one encounter I haven't touched Microsoft forms since or the VB.net framework.
